- [Benchmarking TrapdoorTechZprize MSM & arkworks(0.4) MSM](https://hackmd.io/ZCxFpQ8AROyYGTl5GLqAGQ)

## Steps to run the benchmarks

There are currently 2 algorithms for benchmarking:

- `arkworks_pippenger`
- `trapdoortech_zprize_msm`

### mopro-core tests

To run the benchmarks of the instance size of $2^{16}$ on BLS12_377 curve in `mopro-core`, replace `<algorithm_you_want_to_test>` with the algorithm name listed above.

```bash
cargo test --release --features gpu-benchmarks --package mopro-core --lib -- middleware::gpu_explorations::<algorithm_you_want_to_test>::tests::test_run_benchmark --exact --nocapture
```

Run the benchmarks for multiple instance size. You can customize your own benchmark parameters on modular files in `mopro-core\src\middleware\gpu_explorations`
```bash
cargo test --release --features gpu-benchmarks --package mopro-core --lib -- middleware::gpu_explorations::<algorithm_you_want_to_test>::tests::test_run_multi_benchmarks --exact --nocapture
```

More context about the benchmark:
- It would generate instances size on BLS12_377 curve with scalar size of 32 bytes (i.e. can represent 0 to $2^{256}-1$ unsigned integer.) in `mopro-core/src/middlware/gpu-explorations/utils/vectors/`
- The instance size mean the amount of points and scalars.
- The msm time is linear to the size of instance.

The results are as below:

### ios benchmarking

1. install `mopro-cli` (See [Getting Started](https://zkmopro.org/docs/getting-started)).
2. cd to the `research/gpu-exploration-app` directory.
3. run `mopro build --platforms ios` (remember to change your ios_device_type `simulator`/`device`) to build and update the bindings.
4. open `ios/ExampleApp/ExampleApp.xcworkspace` in Xcode.
5. choose your simulator/mobile device and build the project (can also use `cmd + R` as hot key).
6. choose `MSMBenchmark` and choose the algorithms and click the button below you want to start benchmark.

### `ExampleGpuExploration` in templates

> The example project would be created soon.
